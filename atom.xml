      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 16 September 2020</h1>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p>
<p>Our very own Mark Little goes into detail to explain Quarkus and Jakarta EE compatibility. Mark gives an insightful breakdown of the history for both projects and answers a much asked question, will Quarkus and Jarkata EE come together? No spoilers here, though. Go read Mark’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/11/quarkus-and-jakarta-ee-together-or-not/">Quarkus and Jakarta EE: Together, or not?</a> if you already haven’t.</p>
<p>In the evangelist’s corner, Eric Schabell has brought out an excellent <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/beginners-guide-to-decision-management-retail-web-shop.html">hands-on workshop with labs</a> for Red Hat Decision Manager that show you how to design and build a retail web shop from scratch.</p>
<p>Eric also teams up with Ramon Villarreal to bring you architectural blueprints for <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">cloud-native financial payment services</a>. The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.</p>
<p>Leon Matthews continues the topic of all things financial with his analysis of the history of Java in the banking sector and the role Quarkus is playing in allowing banks and financial institutions to embrace change, innovate to remain competitive, and become more efficient. Read Leon’s post: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/25-years-and-going-strong-why-java-matters-future-banks?source=bloglisting">25 years and going strong: Why Java matters to the future of banks</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Quarkus, Clement Escoffier shows you how to build a stream of beer and then retrieve beers in a reactive way. After walking you through how you can do that with Mutiny, Clement provides a gist with all the code that you can compile and execute with jbang and a single command. You can find everything in his <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-pagination/">Handling paginated APIs with Mutiny</a> post.</p>
<p>Another post from the Quarkus team that is worth reading is Jeff Beck’s <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/wipro-customer-story/">Wipro Addresses Seismic Shift in Retail with Quarkus</a>. Jeff shares the Wipro story by describing their needs and challenges and how they adopted Quarkus to modernize their applications and address customer use cases.</p>
<p>If it hasn’t crossed your radar, Bela Ban shows us his plans for a <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/09/one-size-fits-all-jgroups.html">One Size Fits All JGroups</a> program and explains what is needed to get there.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team shares a post that looks at using the <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/01/enforce-custom-resource-policies-with-opa-gatekeeper/">Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper project to enforce policies when creating custom resources</a> and demonstrates how this is useful. While the post focuses on Strimzi, Jakub points out how Gatekeeper can be used with other projects so go take a look.</p>
<p>Releases!!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Infinispan team for releasing the Dev03 cut of Infinispan 12. Cross-site replication capabilities continue to advance with an SPI that includes configurable policies for merging conflicting values from asynchronous backups, a feature which guarantees data consistency between global Infinispan clusters. That’s no small feat of engineering! Find out about that and more over on the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/09/08/infinispan-12/">Infinispan blog</a>.</p>
<p>Quarkus 1.8 is out with some shiny new features, including jbang integration for easy Quarkus-based scripting, support for multiple persistence units for the Hibernate ORM extension, a new Micrometer extension, and update to GraalVM 20.2 for building native apps from Quarkus projects. Here is the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-8-0-final-released/">announcement with all the info</a>.</p>
<p>Keycloak have announced their new Account Console, built on React and PatternFly 4. The latest version offers a fresher look and feel with custom themes and extensions. Go <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2020/09/new-account-console.adoc">check it out</a>.</p>

      <h1>JBoss Weekly Editorial 27 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial!
Summer is drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Red Hat has been resting, or that nothing has been happening over the past two weeks.
There’s been some great movement and progress made, which we’ll cover.
In this edition we’re going to focus on OpenShift, the blogosphere, and finally, other project news.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_openshift">OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Last week was KubeCon Europe 2020, which as you can guess, was a big event for OpenShift!
We had 15 speakers from Red Hat speaking over the three days, giving 17 talks.
A number of new announcements, blog posts, and articles came out during KubeCon Europe 2020, They’re all liked at <a href="https://www.openshift.com/kubecon">the OpenShift event page</a>.
There’s simply too many to link here.
The above event page has videos, press release links, links to other announcements and blogs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Continuing the trend about OpenShift, Paul Vergilis wrote about external clients and Red Hat AMQ over at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/26/connecting-external-clients-to-red-hat-amq-broker-on-red-hat-openshift/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
If you’re interested in getting started with Strimzi, Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, you’ll want to catch up on the blog post Paolo Patierno and Jakub Scholz wrote: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/14/introduction-to-strimzi-apache-kafka-on-kubernetes-kubecon-europe-2020/">Introduction to Strimzi: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes (KubeCon Europe 2020)</a>.
For those of you running OpenJDK 8, you’ll want to know more about JDK Flight Recorder available in OpenJDK 8u262. An indepth intro is available at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/25/get-started-with-jdk-flight-recorder-in-openjdk-8u/">Red Hat Developer Blog</a> written by Mario Torre.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_projects">Projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>To wrap up this edition, we will be looking at two announcements from Keycloak:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/08/keycloak-1101-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.1 released</a> - fixing seven bugs</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 13 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_5">JGroups 5!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Exciting news from Bela Ban as <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/08/jgroups-500final-released.html">JGroups 5.0.0.Final</a> is released. JGroups 5 brings lots of improvements and some major API changes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Message"><code>Message</code></a> is now an interface with a number of subclasses that perform late marshalling so object payload is serialized at the point when messages are sent, which eliminates a memory allocation and makes JGroups performance even better.</p>
<p>Other cool features in JGroups 5 are <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">virtual thread support</a>, an implementation of the Random Early Drop (RED) protocol, more efficient FD_ALL3 failure detection, a new protocol to dump stats, and lots more.</p>
<p>Hearty congratulations to Bela and all the contributors and folks who made it happen!!</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html">JGroups 5 documentation</a> and find out more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keycloak_tech_talk">Keycloak Tech Talk</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Stian Thorgersen of the Keycloak team presents a DevNation Tech Talk that provides an in-depth look at the best open-source identity and management solution around. Stian gives a great demo of Keycloak that not only highlights features but showcases just how easy it is to integrate and use Keycloak capabilities to secure your applications.</p>
<p>Spend half an hour and let Stian dazzle you with <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/a-deep-dive-into-keycloak/">A deep dive into Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reactive_quarkus_a_java_mutiny">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Another Tech Talk that you should definitely check out comes from Clement Escoffier and Edson Yanaga, who go into detail about Mutiny, a new reactive programming library. Clement and Edson explain why reactive matters, how Mutiny is makes it easier to develop reactive applications, and how the library is integrated with Quarkus.</p>
<p>Listen to Clement and Edson deliver their excellent talk, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/reactive-quarkus-a-java-mutiny/">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_skupper_and_the_hybrid_cloud">Skupper and the Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>By now I’m sure you’ve heard of <a href="https://skupper.io/">Skupper</a> but maybe have yet to see it in action. Ted Ross gives a great introduction and live demonstration of Skupper across AWS, GCP, and Azure that shows real-time load balancing and fail-over.</p>
<p>Watch Ted’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/10/kubernetes-and-the-hybrid-cloud-with-skupper/">Kubernetes and the hybrid cloud with Skupper</a> Tech Talk today. You won’t regret it.</p>

<h2 id="_in_the_community">In the Community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Katia Aresti has created a pretty awesome Infinispan Server tutorial that demonstrates a full set of capabilities with a weather application. Visit the <a href="https://infinispan.org/infinispan-server-tutorial/">Infinispan Remote Weather App Tutorial</a> and try it for yourself.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team has written a comprehensive blog post, <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/08/05/using-open-policy-agent-with-strimzi-and-apache-kafka/">Using Open Policy Agent with Strimzi and Apache Kafka</a>, that explores support for Kafka authorization using Open Policy Agent.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30th July 2020: No rest for the JBoss community!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! The last two weeks have been pretty rich on published content and releases, so let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_spring_boot_to_quarkus">From Spring Boot to Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As Quarkus community is increasing the question of how to migrate to this new framework (or rather runtime) often arises. If you happen to have such predicament with Spring Boot, I’m sure you’ll be quite interested to read this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/17/migrating-spring-boot-tests-to-quarkus/">migrating Spring Boot tests to Quarkus</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_secure_vue_js_with_keycloak">Secure vue.js with Keycloak</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If most of the content we mentioned today is made of articles, we have one, quite cool video content to share. It’s coming straight from one of the tech-talks of the DevNation and we hope you’ll like it :  <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/secure-vuejs-keycloak">Secure vue.js using Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_double_your_performance_with_virtual_threads">JGroups: Double your performance with virtual threads!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quite a lot of exciting things are happening in the realm of JGroups lately! Last time, we already mentioned the <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a>, but Bela Ban, the creator of project, got us even more excited with this news about <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">how one can double its performance using virtual threads (fibers) on JDK15/16</a>!!! This JDK is still a bit down the road, but its certainly a nice glimpse into tomorrow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_back_to_the_basics">Back to the Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As said above, the last two weeks have been particularly rich in interesting content around the JBoss community and the Java ecosystem at large. Some of those articles took the time to go back and rethink some aspects of our work that we take for granted. Let’s first mention this original take on java programming that focuses on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/09/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-tame-inconsistent-state-in-your-java-code/">taming inconsistent state in a Java code</a>.</p>
<p>This first article is already pretty centered around coding, but this next one goes into the very guts of Infinispan! If you know the project, I’m sure you’ll find this entry on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/22/anchored-keys/">anchored keys</a> as fascinating as I did!</p>
<p>Let’s also revisit a classic: load balancing a JEE app server (such as Wildfly or its product counterpart JBoss EAP), but with a twist: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/15/load-balancing-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-subclusters-with-mod_cluster/">Load balancing Red Hat JBoss EAP with subclusters</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>No rest for the wicked! And no, no rest for our very own Eric D. Schabell! In the last two weeks, he has been quite busy again. First of all, he got his very <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/what-the-dev-podcast-episode-44-agile-integration.html">first interview on a podcast</a> (yep, that’s right, he was never on a podcast before!). With the host, he discussed the best practices for Agile integration. If you are interested in this topic, fetch the episode, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>That’s not all. Eric also took the time to update and release his "fully updated to the latest release" version of his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/beginners-guide-building-a-retail-web-shop-workshop-update.html">Beginners guide - Building a retail web shop workshop update</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, he took the time to describe <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/how-to-install-rhpam-77.html">how to How to Install Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7</a> and share his experience with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/shift-remote-2020-devops-heroes.html">Shift Remote 2020 online conference</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases_releases_releases">Releases, releases, releases,…​</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, the JBoss community has been pretty busy in the last weeks and a few projects have seized the relative quietness of Summer to release new version of their product:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/07/keycloak-1100-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.0</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_decaf">Decaf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>For once, this section stays rather close to Java, covering how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/27/deploy-your-java-web-application-into-the-cloud-using-eclipse-jkube/">deploy your Java Webapp into the cloud using Eclipse JKube</a>. So, yes, we’ll talk Kubernetes, but in a context quite close to home :) .</p>
<p>That’s all for another edition of the JBoss Editorial, please join us again for more exciting development from the JBoss Communities.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Summer has begun, well, at least for those of you readers living in the northern hemisphere :)! So let’s enjoy it by giving some nice, interesting and exciting reading material to enjoy while resting in the sun (with your mask, #staysafe!).</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_infinispan_11">Infinispan 11!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s out! The new major version of Infinispan is here! Please go and check out <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/03/infinispan-11/">Infinispan 11</a>!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_new_netty_transport">JGroups: new Netty transport!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’ve said it many times, JGroups is an incredible piece of software. The power and the flexibility of the frameworks always dazzle me, so I’m very excited about this <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a> getting into it!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ansible_collection_for_jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s a pet project of mine that I have already mentioned a few months ago: Andrew Block, Roel Holzmans and I have been working on integrating further Widlfy (and EAP) into Ansible, in order to ensure that one can use the tool to fine-tune as much as possible the JEE server’s configuration. We leverage an existing Open Source Java tool called <a href="https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff">JCliff</a> to just that.</p>
<p>Last year, we released a role, already available in <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff">Ansible Galaxy</a>, to integrate JCliff into Ansible. However, since then, the Ansible community released a new format to distribute extension, called Ansible Collection. We therefore decide to migrate our content there and we finally released, just this week, a very first version: <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat/jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p>So, please check it out! All you need to do is $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jcliff:0.0.1 and, voilà, the collection is installed and you can start to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/ansible_collections_jcliff_demo">play with it</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot! This release also supports, on tops of Linux, MacOSX with homebrew! (Windows using Chocolatey is coming next).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_serverless_and_microservice">Serverless and Microservice</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As alluring as “serverless” is, it does, like any other technology, come with its own challenges. Follow Christina as she goes through the importance of having the proper infrastructure to support your “serverless” apps in this well thought out blog entry: <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/07/serverless-integration-components.html">Serverless Integration Components</a></p>
<p>Follow this first read, you may want to take a look at this other article on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/07/operators-and-sidecars-are-new-model.html">operators and sidecars are the new model</a>, which also discuss similar concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_microprofile">Microprofile</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release JBoss EAP XP, there are a lot of opportunities to develop supported microprofile application. So if you want to explore how to develop such an application, please follow <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/author/ehugonne/">Emmanuel Hugonnet</a>’s tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/01/develop-eclipse-microprofile-applications-on-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-with-red-hat-codeready-workspaces/">Develop Eclipse MicroProfile applications on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0 with Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_decafquarkus_workshops_automated_with_ansible">Decaf—Quarkus Workshops automated with Ansible</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yeah, I know, we just talked about Ansible! Where is my Java stuff you are rightly asking. Well, as you’ll see Ansible, while being Python, plays well with Java software, as demonstrated by this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/03/automate-workshop-setup-with-ansible-playbooks-and-codeready-workspaces/">automate workshop setup with Ansible playbooks and CodeReady workspaces</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 26 June 2020</h1>
      <p>Here we are, once again at the close of June.
Another summer has begun, albeit a little different than most.
I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and doing well.
There have been some very interesting blogs posted in the past couple of weeks that we’ll discuss in this edition, as well as a few releases.</p>
<p>Operators in Kubernetes provide an extension point for the platform.
They follow a pattern allowing you to manage resources and applications within the cluster.
An operator can be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped.
Did you know, however, that you can convert between the two?
That is exactly what Abhishek Koserwal details in six steps over on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/26/migrating-a-namespace-scoped-operator-to-a-cluster-scoped-operator/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Abhishek walks you through a basic example and provides the full example as a GitHub repo.
Read the article for more information, and reasons why you may want or need to switch between the different scopes.</p>
<p>Multitenancy may be something you deal with everyday, or it may be something you’re looking at adding to your current application base.
Either way, dealing with persistence can be tricky.
Tenants must not see each other’s data, but be allowed to operate simultaneously.
Your application must also perform well while still being easy to maintain.
Rhuan Rocha has started a two part series on how to use JPA with Multitenancy over on the Red Hat Developer blog.
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">The first entry</a> details the problem and presents a possible solution using WildFly and EJBs.
Expect the next installment to look more at Hibernate and JPA solutions.</p>
<p>Effortlessly building a native application is of course, one of the amazing capabilities of Quarkus.
However, when it comes to debugging, a native Quarkus application makes debugging <strong>very</strong> difficult.
A large part of this is the optimizations that happen to create that quick, small, native binary.
This debugging complication hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Andrew Dinn has been working on this problem.
He contributed a solution where the debug information is embedded with in the native image and can be access with <code>gdb</code>.
If you’d like to learn more about the solution, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/debugging-graalvm-native-images-using-gdb/">read Andrew’s blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Quarkus theme, Durgesh Anaokar wrote about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/19/develop-and-test-a-quarkus-client-on-red-hat-codeready-containers-with-red-hat-data-grid-8-0/">developing and testing a Quarkus Red Hat Data Grid client using Red Hat CodeReady Containers</a>.
Durgesh details installing CRC (Red Hat Code Ready Containers) and Data Grid on OpenShift 4 as well as running the client.
Naturally, his project code is hosted in GitHub, you’ll find that link in his blog entry.</p>
<p>Red Hat now has images, Universal Base Images to be exact, of OpenJDK (8 and 11) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.
A Universal Base Image (UBI) is an OCI-compliant container base OS image with runtime and language support that can be used as the base for Docker images and Podman/Buildah images.
These will allow you to deploy and build supportable applications on Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL.
It also includes a number of additional user-space packages over a base UBI.
Read more about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/introducing-the-red-hat-build-of-the-openjdk-universal-base-images-now-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-2/">over at Red Hat Developers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following, you’ll know the Infinispan team has been hard at work on Infinispan 11.
They are proud to announce that <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/15/infinispan-11/">Inifinspan 11.0.0. Final has been released</a>!
A number of improvements and features have been added to this release including clustering, CLI, Hot Rod Client improvements, non-blocking internals, and others.</p>
<p>Along with that new Infinispan release, you can now deploy a <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/16/native-server-announce/">natively compiled version of the Infinispan server</a>!
The memory footprint is only 286MB.
There are also native Quarkus extensions for your Quarkus based applications.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the cloud native party, Apache Camel is <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/18/camel-k-1-0-the-serverless-integration-platform-goes-ga/">announcing the GA release of Apache Camel K 1.0</a>.
This release includes tooling, connectors, and integrations with Knative.
This is a great step forward for doing integrations with a small footprint.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/17/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-released/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0</a> was recently released.
This is a patch that adds MicroProfile capabilities to JBoss EAP.
There are some policy changes you will need to be aware of, but you find links to all of thosewithin the announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being with us on another JBoss Editorial!</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>We’re a little light on the news this time, but those of us who have been reading the editorial for a few years will be familiar with the "after Summit slump."
With Red Hat Summit behind us (and what a great Summit, check out the sessions on demand if you missed them), many people have taken PTO.
Expect all the news, blogs, releases, etc. to pick back up in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>All that being said, we do have some blogs to go over and one release.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>First up is Eric Schabell’s second entry in his "Demystifying the Event Driven Architecture - Making the case" series.
You can read more about it <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/05/demystifying-event-driven-architecture-making-the-case.html">at his blog</a>.</p>
<p>We have another post by Eric: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/05/code-ready-containers-installing-hr-employee-rewards-project.html">Code Ready Containers - Installing an HR employee rewards project using developer container catalog</a>.

<h2 id="_2020_04_30_the_virtual_red_hat_summit_week">[2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’m writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit.
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100%
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to
accommodate many more timezones.</p>
<p>Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that
went beyond the talk format. For examples see
<em>Ask the experts</em>, <em>Networking social hour</em>, and
the <em>Virtual Open Neighborhood</em> on the
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to attend, or want to catch some of the
talks you missed, you can <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/QReg.htm?ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74">re-live the virtual event here</a>.</p>
